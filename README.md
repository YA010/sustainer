This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Setting firebase environment

Fyi I setup authentication using firebase, below are  the enviroment variables, they are safe to be sent and seen by client side browsers, :

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=api-key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=auth-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=storage-bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=sender-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=app-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=analytic-id
```

## Getting Started

I would recommend using the site but if you want to run locally 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying the files. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
